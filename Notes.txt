insert function in python adds the element in the position/index 
specified
syntax : list_variable.insert(1,289)

Here, 1 is the index value and 289 in the value to be added in list
Python list is a dynamic array -> changes its size

Why Linked list?
    In array, if we need to add an element in the middle,the values are moved 
to next address location creating a space to insert the new element. for an
array with large no of elements, the time complexity increased also think of 
how dynamic array extends its space. Hence we use Linked List.

Benefits :
   No previous allocation of size 
   Insertion is easier

Time complexity of linked list traversal = O(n)
